This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) frontend bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and a backend powered by [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/).

## Getting Started

First, open a terminal of your choice and navigate to the location of the cloned repository.
Run the backend server with

```bash
TODO
```

then run the frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend/insurancesweb
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

API routes - The API currently supports the following routes:

```bash
GET /api/GetAllInsurances
```

A API testing tool is required to test the endpoints, we recommend [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for testing purposes. To make things even simpler you can use the already prepared [Postman collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/89b2d6f34822e2f1eee1) to test all the requests!

<!-- [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages. -->

<!-- ## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
